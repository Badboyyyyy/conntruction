          <div class="productContent">
            <p>Paver Blocks also known as Brick paving is a commonly used decorative method of creating a pavement or hard standing. The main benefit of bricks over other materials is that individual bricks can later be lifted up and replaced. This allows for remedial work to be carried out under the surface of the paving without leaving a lasting mark once the paving bricks have been replaced. Bricks are typically made of concrete or clay, though other composite materials are also used. Each has its own means of construction. The biggest difference is the way they set hard ready for use. A clay brick has to be fired in a kiln to bake the brick hard. A concrete brick has to be allowed to set. The concrete paving bricks are a porous form of brick formed by mixing small stone hardcore, dyes, cement and sand and other materials in various amounts. Many block paving manufacturing methods are now allowing the use of recycled materials in the construction of the paving bricks such as crushed glass and crushed old building rubble</p>

          <p>The construction process and masonry can be tedious, time consuming, and expensive. To overcome the hardships and issues encountered during construction, varied methods of construction is being considered and developed. Simultaneously, materials and equipment used for construction are also being fabricated to enhance the quality of construction and furthermore minimize the time and cost. Interlocking bricks is one such advancement in the construction industry.</p>
          <p>Interlocking bricks are compressed and stabilized earth bricks which contributes to strength of the structure. They are usually not subjected to baking. Interlocking bricks come in various sizes and locking systems depending on the supplier.</p>
          <p> A typical brick size is 230x100x75mm (9x4x3 in).</p>
          <p>Interlocking bricks made for easy access to infrastructure elements so that portions of walls don't need to be torn down for maintenance. The bricks feature open internal spaces for insulation, which means that buildings made with the bricks require less energy for heating and cooling.</p>

            <p>A cover block is basically a spacer that is used to lift the rebar matrix off the ground so that concrete may flow below the rebar.</p>
            <p>In order to prevent corrosion of the rebar, it has to be totally sheathed in concrete. It usually needs about 2 to 3 inches of coverage on all sides. So the cover block lifts the rebar up by about 2 to 3 inches and becomes a permanent and integral part of the poured concrete, make certain that no part of the rebar sags and minimizes that required concrete coverage throughout the pour.</p>

        <div class="productContent box">
         <p>Paver Blocks also known as Brick paving is a commonly used decorative method of creating a pavement or hard standing. The main benefit of bricks over other materials is that individual bricks can later be lifted up and replaced. This allows for remedial work to be carried out under the surface of the paving without leaving a lasting mark once the paving bricks have been replaced. Bricks are typically made of concrete or clay, though other composite materials are also used. Each has its own means of construction. The biggest difference is the way they set hard ready for use. A clay brick has to be fired in a kiln to bake the brick hard. A concrete brick has to be allowed to set. The concrete paving bricks are a porous form of brick formed by mixing small stone hardcore, dyes, cement and sand and other materials in various amounts. Many block paving manufacturing methods are now allowing the use of recycled materials in the construction of the paving bricks such as crushed glass and crushed old building rubble</p>

          <p>The construction process and masonry can be tedious, time consuming, and expensive. To overcome the hardships and issues encountered during construction, varied methods of construction is being considered and developed. Simultaneously, materials and equipment used for construction are also being fabricated to enhance the quality of construction and furthermore minimize the time and cost. Interlocking bricks is one such advancement in the construction industry.</p>
          <p>Interlocking bricks are compressed and stabilized earth bricks which contributes to strength of the structure. They are usually not subjected to baking. Interlocking bricks come in various sizes and locking systems depending on the supplier.</p>
          <p> A typical brick size is 230x100x75mm (9x4x3 in).</p>
          <p>Interlocking bricks made for easy access to infrastructure elements so that portions of walls don't need to be torn down for maintenance. The bricks feature open internal spaces for insulation, which means that buildings made with the bricks require less energy for heating and cooling.</p>

          <p>In order to prevent corrosion of the rebar, it has to be totally sheathed in concrete. It usually needs about 2 to 3 inches of coverage on all sides. So the cover block lifts the rebar up by about 2 to 3 inches and becomes a permanent and integral part of the poured concrete, make certain that no part of the rebar sags and minimizes that required concrete coverage throughout the pour.</p>
